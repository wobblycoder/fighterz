# fighterz

A simple simulation of fighter planes suitable as an introduction to modeling and simulation (or game programming) intended
for use as a teaching tool.

The code uses the pygame library, in addition to the baseline Python 3.

I used the free versions of PyCharm and Anaconda for my development environment, and the Piskel website to create the sprites for the moving platforms.  The background image was obtained from a free game art repository.
